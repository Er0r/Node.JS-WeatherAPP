# Node.JS-WeatherAPP
Basically I use node.js, express.js, bootstrap to make this website. Which will give you the real time weather status. 

I used <b> accuweather </b> api to make the api call for weather. I will add a new feature of giving you the real time corona virus affected rate updates.

And all you need to giveis <b> Giving the right address of your location to know about the weather status</b>
